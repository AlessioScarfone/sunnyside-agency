# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Sunnyside agency landing page 
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

# Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
